A few months ago, I bought an old game called 221b Baker Street - Master Detective, and I am in love with it. 

My partner and I are so enamored, that we've made a web-based [Mystery Game](https://mystery-game-99a0e.firebaseapp.com/) so I can write my own cases.

The app is based on the boardgame but is very different. I wrote each of the cases myself.
