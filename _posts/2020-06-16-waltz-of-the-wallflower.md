Have you seen how many people are buying converted vans or RVs lately? looks like this is going to be the summer of road trips, I am watching no less than three YouTubers convert or renovate vans so they can tour Canada or the United States. 

At the same time, I'm hearing about countries that are trying to attract tourists by offering free tests on arrival or offering to pay hotel fees for tourists! What do you think? Are you ready to fly again? I don't think I'm quite ready yet. 

For the next two weeks I am getting ready for Camp NaNo starting on July 1st! That means reading lots of historical romance, which is my favorite genre.
