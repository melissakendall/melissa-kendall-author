Welcome to my new website! This is my lame first post, while I try to determine what kind of content I will be posting.

You can expect:

* Cat Pictures
* Instagram Worthy Food Pictures
* Cosplay Costume Pictures
* Book Reviews

Thank you for stopping by!

For my friends in IT, this site was spun up with:

- Forestry CMS
- Netlify
- GitHub

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/4187dbcf-f661-4163-bf96-e954351c81e9/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/melissa-kendall-author-a32b7/deploys)

While you are here, you should check out the author site for [Tanya Lisle](http://tanyalisle.com/). Seeing her amazing website shamed me into improving mine!
