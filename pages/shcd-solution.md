## Solution

In a lofty chamber of St Bart’s Hospital, a lone figure is hunched over a bench, working feverishly with a set of bubbling test tubes. He turns, and in the flickering blue light of the Bunsen lamps, a pair of alert eyes fix on us. 

“Wiggins,” he says. “I have seen rooms on Baker Street I intend to take, if only I can find a fellow willing to share them. With luck, you will not have to visit this dim laboratory again. But now – Gilly the Ghost! I assume you went to her sister Lydia first, whose description of Gilly’s lodging leads to the stable yard rooms listed in The Times. Lydia also said Gilly worked for the Haymarket, and they say they caught her stealing and got her sent to prison in ’79. Aha! Perhaps Gilly wants revenge but has found it difficult because the Haymarket staff say they recognize her even when disguised. Today, she went to Covent Garden Market to collect old fruit and purchase a sailor’s knife. So, disguised as a staff member, she plans to enter the Colonial Institute – the National Gallery would have too much security – and then cross the arch to the theatre, just as Moby Dick begins. Cutting the rope ladder to the balcony, she will pelt the actors with rotten fruit, carried in the bag – note she had been conducting target practice on a barrel in the stable yard at 68 WC. Finally, she could cut the ropes on the plaster whale, letting it fall and shatter, putting an end to the production. However, with your particular talents, I imagine you may have found a way to destroy her disguise and foil her plan.”

The detective walks over and crouches. “Wiggins, I am impressed enough to appoint you and your associates as my unofficial force – the Irregulars!” 

He turns to address us directly. “You must know that working for me will test you to your limits, and perhaps beyond. It will not be easy. But I can promise you this my young friends: you will never want for excitement. There is nothing like the thrill of the chase when the game is afoot!” 

He thrusts a copy of The Times into our hands – a death notice circled in red – and then leans forward with an enigmatic smile we will come to know well.

“So,” he whispers, “Shall we begin?

Holmes would have solved this case in 5 leads: 
1. Lydia Niles (33 WC)
2. Gilly (68 WC)
3. Covent Garden (28 WC)
4. The Haymarket (4 SW)
5. Colonial Institute (86 SW)

He scored 100 points. 

## Answers

1. Colonial Institute (15 points) and the Haymarket (15 points)
2. Rotten fruit to throw at actors and patrons (20 points), knife to cut ropes (20 points)
3. Revenge (30 points)
4. If you burnt the wig and moustache you gain 20 points, and another 20 if you burnt the footman's uniform (clue at the cleaners). 

## Scoring 

Decrease your score by 5 points for every lead after the 5 The Times advertised in th (do not include re-visiting places). 

* 0 or less: At least you tried. 
* 5 – 30: Okay. 
* 35 – 70: Good! 
* 75 – 100: Excellent! 
* 105+: You surpassed the master!
